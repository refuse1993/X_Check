      "text": "Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU) Update: LockBit strikes with new 5.0 version, targeting Windows, Linux and ESXI systems.  ➡️ acronis.com/en/tru/posts/loc…  Key highlights: 🔹The Windows sample has most defense evasion and anti-analysis techniques applied across all analyzed samples. This includes packing, DLL unhooking, process hollowing, patching Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) functions and clearing all available logs in the system.  🔹Linux and ESXI versions are very similar, except for functions that target virtualization. Neither of these versions is packed, but almost all strings are encrypted.  🔹All versions have the same ransom note, append a random extension to each encrypted file, and the same encryption routine that involves XChaCha20 and Curve25519.  🔹The LockBit site was hosted on infrastructure with historical ties to SmokeLoader, indicating possible infrastructure reuse or cooperation.  For MSPs and IT teams, speed matters. Threat research provides the intelligence to update protections quickly, manage efficiently, and automate defenses, so teams can stay protected without adding complexity.",

      "text": "What better way to investigate corporations and governments than taking down Ransomware as a service groups that have taken data and encrypted it.   I have long wondered if our people ran LockBit.  It's not that far fetched when you look at places like Valhalla which was a honeypot ran by the feds on the dark web.   These groups exfiltrate the data and encrypt it demand and a BTC payout.  Pay up and you get the data and the encryption key. Don't pay up and the data is released to the public",
