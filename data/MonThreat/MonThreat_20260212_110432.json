      "text": "🚨 Coinbase Insider Data Access Incident  Coinbase has confirmed an insider-related security incident involving a third-party contractor who improperly accessed customer data in December. According to Coinbase, the activity was detected by internal security monitoring and impacted a very limited number of users, estimated at approximately 30 customers. The contractor accessed sensitive customer information through internal support systems. Exposed data reportedly included personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, KYC-related details, as well as account-level information including cryptocurrency wallet balances and transaction history. Coinbase stated that the contractor’s access was unauthorized and in violation of internal policies. The individual was immediately removed from providing services to Coinbase. Impacted users were notified, offered identity theft protection services, and provided with security guidance. The incident was also disclosed to relevant regulatory authorities in line with standard compliance requirements.  #InsiderThreat #Coinbase #DataBreach #ThreatIntelligence",
